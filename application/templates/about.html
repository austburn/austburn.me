    <p>Hi! My name is Austin Burnett and I am currently a platform engineer at <a class="content-link" href="https://atlassian.com">Atlassian</a> working on <a class="content-link" href="https://www.hipchat.com/data-center">HipChat Data Center</a>.</p>
    <p>I plan for this blog to be a stream of what I'm currently interested in. At the time of starting this blog, I had an interest in networking and
    networking security, hence the first post. Aside from networking, I have interests in front-end development, data science, application analytics and
    Linux system administration. While I may not have substantial experience in these fields, they tend to be where I focus my learning.</p>
    <p>When I'm not learning or thinking of what could be, I like to fly fish, play disc golf, camp, and cook. If you have any feed back or want to connect,
    feel free to ping me on <a class="content-link" href="https://www.twitter.com/austburn">Twitter</a>.</p>
