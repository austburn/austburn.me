Hi! My name is Austin Burnett and I am currently a senior developer at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) working in our Trust Organization.

This blog is a stream of things I'm interested in, working on, or doing.

I'll probably reinvent this blog several times over. It has some fun technical relics, maybe still relevant, but
who knows. It'll likely have the odd technical post, but I am focusing more on my time outside work these days.
