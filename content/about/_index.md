Hi! My name is Austin Burnett and I am currently a platform engineer at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) working on [HipChat Data Center](https://www.hipchat.com/data-center).

I plan for this blog to be a stream of what I'm currently interested in. I have interests in front-end development, data science, application analytics and Linux system administration. While I may not have substantial experience in these fields, they tend to be where I focus my learning. When I'm not learning or thinking of what could be, I like to fly fish, play disc golf, camp, and cook. While initially this was designed to be a developer blog, I hope to write about some of my hobbies as well.
